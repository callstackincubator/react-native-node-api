# `react-native-node-api-cmake`

A wrapper around CMake making it easier to produce [prebuilt binaries](./docs/PREBUILDS.md) targeting iOS and Android matching the [the prebuilt binary specification](./docs/PREBUILDS.md).

Serves the same purpose as `cmake-js` does for the Node.js community and could potentially be upstreamed into `cmake-js` eventually.
