# `ferric`

A wrapper around Cargo making it easier to produce prebuilt binaries targeting iOS and Android matching [the prebuilt binary specification](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-node-api/blob/main/docs/PREBUILDS.md) as well as [napi.rs](https://napi.rs/) to generate bindings from annotated Rust code.
